What comes to mind when you think about therapy for psychological
problems? You might picture someone lying on a couch talking about his
childhood while the therapist sits and takes notes, à la Sigmund Freud.
But can you envision a therapy session in which someone is wearing
virtual reality headgear to conquer a fear of snakes?

In this chapter, you will see that approaches to therapy include both
psychological and biological interventions, all with the goal of
alleviating distress. Because psychological problems can originate from
various sources—biology, genetics, childhood experiences, conditioning,
and sociocultural influences—psychologists have developed many different
therapeutic techniques and approaches. The Ocean Therapy program shown
in `[link] <#CNX_Psych_16_00_Therapy>`__ uses multiple approaches to
support the mental health of veterans in the group.
