   etymology of the word “psychology” \* Define psychology \* Understand
   the merits of an education in psychology

In Greek mythology, Psyche was a mortal woman whose beauty was so great
that it rivaled that of the goddess Aphrodite. Aphrodite became so
jealous of Psyche that she sent her son, Eros, to make Psyche fall in
love with the ugliest man in the world. However, Eros accidentally
pricked himself with the tip of his arrow and fell madly in love with
Psyche himself. He took Psyche to his palace and showered her with
gifts, yet she could never see his face. While visiting Psyche, her
sisters roused suspicion in Psyche about her mysterious lover, and
eventually, Psyche betrayed Eros’ wishes to remain unseen to her
(`[link] <#CNX_Psych_01_01_PsycheEros>`__). Because of this betrayal,
Eros abandoned Psyche. When Psyche appealed to Aphrodite to reunite her
with Eros, Aphrodite gave her a series of impossible tasks to complete.
Psyche managed to complete all of these trials; ultimately, her
perseverance paid off as she was reunited with Eros and was ultimately
transformed into a goddess herself (Ashliman, 2001; Greek Myths & Greek
Mythology, 2014).

Psyche comes to represent the human soul’s triumph over the misfortunes
of life in the pursuit of true happiness (Bulfinch, 1855); in fact, the
Greek word **psyche**\ {: data-type=“term”} means soul, and it is often
represented as a butterfly. The word *psychology* was coined at a time
when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished
(Green, 2001). The root **ology**\ {: data-type=“term”} denotes
scientific study of, and **psychology**\ {: data-type=“term”} refers to
the scientific study of the mind. Since science studies only observable
phenomena and the mind is not directly observable, we expand this
definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior.

The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific
method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a
researcher with a question about how or why something happens will
propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis is not just any explanation; it should fit into
the context of a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a broad
explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural
world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is
the best understanding that we have of that part of the natural world.
Armed with the hypothesis, the researcher then makes observations or,
better still, carries out an experiment to test the validity of the
hypothesis. That test and its results are then published so that others
can check the results or build on them. It is necessary that any
explanation in science be testable, which means that the phenomenon must
be perceivable and measurable. For example, that a bird sings because it
is happy is not a testable hypothesis, since we have no way to measure
the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about
the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. In general,
science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that
can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and
morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are
neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of
empiricism. An **empirical method**\ {: data-type=“term”} for acquiring
knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather
than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous
authorities.

It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its
own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were
considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a
natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in
isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with
others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.

MERITS OF AN EDUCATION IN PSYCHOLOGY
====================================

Often, students take their first psychology course because they are
interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and
why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology
course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is
required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of
these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to
declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the
most popular majors on college campuses across the United States
(Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were
psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s
creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist
Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen,
2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United
States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of
Education, 2013).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons.
Psychology students hone critical thinking skills and are trained in the
use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active
application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and
evaluation of that information. The evaluation of information—assessing
its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of
competing “facts,” many of which are designed to be misleading. For
example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of
skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking,
asking appropriate questions, and making observations. Psychology
students also can develop better communication skills during the course
of their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association,
2011). Together, these factors increase students’ scientific literacy
and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of
information they encounter.

In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to
understand the complex factors that shape one’s behavior. They
appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our
experiences in determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn
about basic principles that guide how we think and behave, and they come
to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and
across cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

Summary
=======

Psychology derives from the roots *psyche* (meaning soul) and *–ology*
(meaning scientific study of). Thus, psychology is defined as the
scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop
critical thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method,
and recognize the complexity of behavior.

Critical Thinking Questions
===========================

.. container::

   .. container::

      Why do you think psychology courses like this one are often
      requirements of so many different programs of study?

   .. container::

      Psychology courses deal with a number of issues that are helpful
      in a variety of settings. The text made mention of the types of
      skills as well as the knowledge base with which students of
      psychology become familiar. As mentioned in the link to learning,
      psychology is often helpful/valued in fields in which interacting
      with others is a major part of the job.

.. container::

   .. container::

      Why do you think many people might be skeptical about psychology
      being a science?

   .. container::

      One goal of psychology is the study of the mind. Science cannot
      directly study the mind, because it is not a form of matter or
      energy. This might create some skepticism about the scientific
      nature of psychology.
