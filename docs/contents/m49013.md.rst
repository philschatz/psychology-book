   By the end of this section, you will be able to: \* Explain how
   scientific research addresses questions about behavior \* Discuss how
   scientific research guides public policy \* Appreciate how scientific
   research can be important in making personal decisions

Scientific research is a critical tool for successfully navigating our
complex world. Without it, we would be forced to rely solely on
intuition, other people’s authority, and blind luck. While many of us
feel confident in our abilities to decipher and interact with the world
around us, history is filled with examples of how very wrong we can be
when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At
various times in history, we would have been certain that the sun
revolved around a flat earth, that the earth’s continents did not move,
and that mental illness was caused by possession
(`[link] <#CNX_Psych_02_01_trephining>`__). It is through systematic
scientific research that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions
and superstitions and gain an objective understanding of ourselves and
our world.

The goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around
them. Psychologists focus their attention on understanding behavior, as
well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that
underlie behavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to
understand the behavior of others, such as intuition and personal
experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is
evidence to support a claim. Scientific knowledge is **empirical**\ {:
data-type=“term” .no-emphasis}: It is grounded in objective, tangible
evidence that can be observed time and time again, regardless of who is
observing.

While behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we
can see behavior. However, the reason for the behavior is more difficult
to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?
Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone’s behavior by simply
asking a question, like “Why are you crying?” However, there are
situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling
to answer the question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For
example, infants would not be able to explain why they are crying. In
such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to
better understand behavior. This chapter explores how scientific
knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in forming
decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.

USE OF RESEARCH INFORMATION
===========================

Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the
scientific community can be difficult, especially in an area of research
as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible
amount of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on
any given research topic might result in a number of contradictory
studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community
going through the process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite
some time before a consensus emerges. For example, the hypothesized link
between exposure to media violence and subsequent aggression has been
debated in the scientific community for roughly 60 years. Even today, we
will find detractors, but a consensus is building. Several professional
organizations view media violence exposure as a risk factor for actual
violence, including the American Medical Association, the American
Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association
(American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child & Adolescent
Psychiatry, American Psychological Association, American Medical
Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Psychiatric
Association, 2000).

In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the
information we encounter by exercising a degree of healthy skepticism.
When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of
different perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the
claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid, does the claim seem
justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the
claim? This is especially important when we consider how much
information in advertising campaigns and on the internet claims to be
based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or
perspective of just a few individuals trying to sell a product or draw
attention to their perspectives.

We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us
because decisions based on this information have significant
consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public
policy. Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your
state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the state budget and
determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new
governor, you need to decide whether to continue funding the
**D.A.R.E.**\ {: data-type=“term” .no-emphasis} (Drug Abuse Resistance
Education) program in public schools
(`[link] <#CNX_Psych_02_01_DARE>`__). This program typically involves
police officers coming into the classroom to educate students about the
dangers of becoming involved with alcohol and other drugs. According to
the D.A.R.E. website (www.dare.org), this program has been very popular
since its inception in 1983, and it is currently operating in 75% of
school districts in the United States and in more than 40 countries
worldwide. Sounds like an easy decision, right? However, on closer
review, you discover that the vast majority of research into this
program consistently suggests that participation has little, if any,
effect on whether or not someone uses alcohol or other drugs (Clayton,
Cattarello, & Johnstone, 1996; Ennett, Tobler, Ringwalt, & Flewelling,
1994; Lynam et al., 1999; Ringwalt, Ennett, & Holt, 1991). If you are
committed to being a good steward of taxpayer money, will you fund this
particular program, or will you try to find other programs that research
has consistently demonstrated to be effective?

   more about some of the controversial issues surrounding the D.A.R.E.
   program.

Ultimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using
research in guiding their decisions. We all might look to research from
time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found
out that a close friend has breast cancer or that one of your young
relatives has recently been diagnosed with autism. In either case, you
want to know which treatment options are most successful with the fewest
side effects. How would you find that out? You would probably talk with
your doctor and personally review the research that has been done on
various treatment options—always with a critical eye to ensure that you
are as informed as possible.

In the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and
opinions. **Facts**\ {: data-type=“term”} are observable realities, and
**opinions**\ {: data-type=“term”} are personal judgments, conclusions,
or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the scientific
community, facts can be established only using evidence collected
through empirical research.

THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
==================================

Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the
**scientific method**\ {: data-type=“term” .no-emphasis}. Basically,
ideas (in the form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the
real world (in the form of empirical observations), and those empirical
observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world,
and so on. In this sense, the scientific process is circular. The types
of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In
**deductive reasoning**\ {: data-type=“term”}, ideas are tested against
the empirical world; in **inductive reasoning**\ {: data-type=“term”},
empirical observations lead to new ideas
(`[link] <#CNX_Psych_02_01_Reasoning>`__). These processes are
inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research
approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive
aspects.

|A diagram has a box at the top labeled “hypothesis or general premise”
and a box at the bottom labeled “empirical observations.” On the left,
an arrow labeled “inductive reasoning” goes from the bottom to top box.
On the right, an arrow labeled “deductive reasoning” goes from the top
to the bottom box.|\ {: #CNX_Psych_02_01_Reasoning}

In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a
generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used to reach logical
conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the
logical conclusions reached through deductive reasoning should also be
correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go something like this:
All living things require energy to survive (this would be your
hypothesis). Ducks are living things. Therefore, ducks require energy to
survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is
correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes,
however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a logical but incorrect
conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability
to see. Quackers is a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the
ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically test
their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers
might design a study to test the hypothesis that if all living things
require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to
survive.

Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against
real-world observations; however, inductive reasoning moves in the
opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to
construct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions
drawn from inductive reasoning may or may not be correct, regardless of
the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may notice
that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on
trees; therefore, you assume that all fruit must grow on trees. This
would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence
of strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this
generalization is not correct despite it being based on a number of
direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate
theories, which in turn generate hypotheses that are tested with
deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and
inductive processes.

For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next
section, are heavily weighted on the side of empirical observations.
Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as
researchers gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting
patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental research, on the other
hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.

   reasoning.

We’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of
ideas are they, exactly? A **theory**\ {: data-type=“term”} is a
well-developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed
phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked against the world, but they
tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers
create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.

A **hypothesis**\ {: data-type=“term”} is a testable prediction about
how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often worded
as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a
passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is extremely important
because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real
world. As specific hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and
refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests
`[link] <#CNX_Psych_02_01_Method>`__.

|A diagram has four boxes: the top is labeled “theory,” the right is
labeled “hypothesis,” the bottom is labeled “research,” and the left is
labeled “observation.” Arrows flow in the direction from top to right to
bottom to left and back to the top, clockwise. The top right arrow is
labeled “use the hypothesis to form a theory,” the bottom right arrow is
labeled “design a study to test the hypothesis,” the bottom left arrow
is labeled “perform the research,” and the top left arrow is labeled
“create or modify the theory.”|\ {: #CNX_Psych_02_01_Method}

To see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a
hypothesis that might be generated from that theory. As you’ll learn in
a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that
emotional experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with
the emotional state. If you walked out of your home and discovered a
very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin
to race and your stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory,
these physiological changes would result in your feeling of fear. A
hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person
who is unaware of the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake
elicits will not feel fear.

A scientific hypothesis is also **falsifiable**\ {: data-type=“term”},
or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the introductory
chapter that Sigmund **Freud**\ {: data-type=“term” .no-emphasis} had
lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors
(`[link] <#CNX_Psych_02_01_freud>`__). However, a major criticism of
Freud’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for
example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would
disprove the existence of the id, the ego, and the superego—the three
elements of personality described in Freud’s theories. Despite this,
Freud’s theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts
because of their historical significance for personality psychology and
psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.

|(a)A photograph shows Freud holding a cigar. (b) The mind’s conscious
and unconscious states are illustrated as an iceberg floating in water.
Beneath the water’s surface in the “unconscious” area are the id, ego,
and superego. The area just below the water’s surface is labeled
“preconscious.” The area above the water’s surface is labeled
“conscious.”|\ {: #CNX_Psych_02_01_freud}

In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable
hypotheses, such as the one described above. Some individuals who suffer
significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the
bodily changes that often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we
could test the hypothesis by determining how emotional experiences
differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes
in their physiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this
research has been conducted and while the emotional experiences of
people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be
less intense, they still experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, &
Gallagher, 1988).

Scientific research’s dependence on falsifiability allows for great
confidence in the information that it produces. Typically, by the time
information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested
repeatedly.

Summary
=======

Scientists are engaged in explaining and understanding how the world
around them works, and they are able to do so by coming up with theories
that generate hypotheses that are testable and falsifiable. Theories
that stand up to their tests are retained and refined, while those that
do not are discarded or modified. In this way, research enables
scientists to separate fact from simple opinion. Having good information
generated from research aids in making wise decisions both in public
policy and in our personal lives.

Critical Thinking Questions
===========================

.. container::

   .. container::

      In this section, the D.A.R.E. program was described as an
      incredibly popular program in schools across the United States
      despite the fact that research consistently suggests that this
      program is largely ineffective. How might one explain this
      discrepancy?

   .. container::

      There is probably tremendous political pressure to appear to be
      hard on drugs. Therefore, even though D.A.R.E. might be
      ineffective, it is a well-known program with which voters are
      familiar.

.. container::

   .. container::

      The scientific method is often described as self-correcting and
      cyclical. Briefly describe your understanding of the scientific
      method with regard to these concepts.

   .. container::

      This cyclical, self-correcting process is primarily a function of
      the empirical nature of science. Theories are generated as
      explanations of real-world phenomena. From theories, specific
      hypotheses are developed and tested. As a function of this
      testing, theories will be revisited and modified or refined to
      generate new hypotheses that are again tested. This cyclical
      process ultimately allows for more and more precise (and
      presumably accurate) information to be collected.

Personal Application Questions
==============================

.. container::

   .. container::

      Healthcare professionals cite an enormous number of health
      problems related to obesity, and many people have an
      understandable desire to attain a healthy weight. There are many
      diet programs, services, and products on the market to aid those
      who wish to lose weight. If a close friend was considering
      purchasing or participating in one of these products, programs, or
      services, how would you make sure your friend was fully aware of
      the potential consequences of this decision? What sort of
      information would you want to review before making such an
      investment or lifestyle change yourself?
