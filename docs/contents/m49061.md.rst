Eating is essential for survival, and it is no surprise that a drive
like hunger exists to ensure that we seek out sustenance. While this
chapter will focus primarily on the physiological mechanisms that
regulate hunger and eating, powerful social, cultural, and economic
influences also play important roles. This section will explain the
regulation of hunger, eating, and body weight, and we will discuss the
adverse consequences of disordered eating.

PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS
========================

There are a number of physiological mechanisms that serve as the basis
for hunger. When our stomachs are empty, they contract. Typically, a
person then experiences hunger pangs. Chemical messages travel to the
brain, and serve as a signal to initiate feeding behavior. When our
blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas and liver generate a number of
chemical signals that induce hunger (Konturek et al., 2003; Novin,
Robinson, Culbreth, & Tordoff, 1985) and thus initiate feeding behavior.

For most people, once they have eaten, they feel **satiation**\ {:
data-type=“term”}, or fullness and satisfaction, and their eating
behavior stops. Like the initiation of eating, satiation is also
regulated by several physiological mechanisms. As blood glucose levels
increase, the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and
eating (Drazen & Woods, 2003; Druce, Small, & Bloom, 2004; Greary,
1990). The food’s passage through the gastrointestinal tract also
provides important satiety signals to the brain (Woods, 2004), and fat
cells release **leptin**\ {: data-type=“term”}, a satiety hormone.

The various **hunger**\ {: data-type=“term” .no-emphasis} and satiety
signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in
the brain. Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and
hindbrain are especially important sites where this integration occurs
(Ahima & Antwi, 2008; Woods & D’Alessio, 2008). Ultimately, activity in
the brain determines whether or not we engage in feeding behavior
(`[link] <#Figure_10_02_Hunger>`__).

METABOLISM AND BODY WEIGHT
==========================

Our body weight is affected by a number of factors, including
gene-environment interactions, and the number of calories we consume
versus the number of calories we burn in daily activity. If our caloric
intake exceeds our caloric use, our bodies store excess energy in the
form of fat. If we consume fewer calories than we burn off, then stored
fat will be converted to energy. Our energy expenditure is obviously
affected by our levels of activity, but our body’s metabolic rate also
comes into play. A person’s **metabolic rate**\ {: data-type=“term”} is
the amount of energy that is expended in a given period of time, and
there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates.
People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more
easily than those with lower rates of metabolism.

We all experience fluctuations in our weight from time to time, but
generally, most people’s weights fluctuate within a narrow margin, in
the absence of extreme changes in diet and/or physical activity. This
observation led some to propose a set-point theory of body weight
regulation. The **set-point theory**\ {: data-type=“term”} asserts that
each individual has an ideal body weight, or set point, which is
resistant to change. This set-point is genetically predetermined and
efforts to move our weight significantly from the set-point are resisted
by compensatory changes in energy intake and/or expenditure (Speakman et
al., 2011).

Some of the predictions generated from this particular theory have not
received empirical support. For example, there are no changes in
metabolic rate between individuals who had recently lost significant
amounts of weight and a control group (Weinsier et al., 2000). In
addition, the set-point theory fails to account for the influence of
social and environmental factors in the regulation of body weight
(Martin-Gronert & Ozanne, 2013; Speakman et al., 2011). Despite these
limitations, set-point theory is still often used as a simple, intuitive
explanation of how body weight is regulated.

OBESITY
=======

When someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for
a given height, they are considered overweight or obese. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an adult with a
**body mass index**\ {: data-type=“term” .no-emphasis} (BMI) between 25
and 29.9 is considered **overweight**\ {: data-type=“term”}
(`[link] <#Figure_10_02_BodyMass>`__). An adult with a **BMI**\ {:
data-type=“term” .no-emphasis} of 30 or higher is considered
**obese**\ {: data-type=“term”} (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], 2012). People who are so overweight that they are at
risk for death are classified as morbidly obese. **Morbid obesity**\ {:
data-type=“term”} is defined as having a BMI over 40. Note that although
BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health
Organization (WHO), the CDC, and other groups, its value as an
assessment tool has been questioned. The BMI is most useful for studying
populations, which is the work of these organizations. It is less useful
in assessing an individual since height and weight measurements fail to
account for important factors like fitness level. An athlete, for
example, may have a high BMI because the tool doesn’t distinguish
between the body’s percentage of fat and muscle in a person’s weight.

|A chart has an x-axis labeled “weight” (pounds/kilograms) and a y-axis
labeled “height” (meters and feet/inches). Four areas are shaded
different colors indicating the BMI for ranges of weight and height. The
“underweight BMI <18.5” area begins at approximately 90 pounds and 4’11”
and extends to approximately 160 pounds and 6’6”. The “normal range BMI
18.5–25” area covers approximately 90–120 pounds at height 4’11” and
extends to approximately 160–220 pounds at height 6’6”. The “overweight
BMI 25–30” area covers approximately 120–140 pounds at height 4’11” and
extends to approximately 220–265 pounds at height 6’6”. The “obese range
BMI >30” area covers approximately 140–350 pounds at height 4’11” and
extends to approximately 265–350 pounds at height 6’6.”|\ {:

Being extremely overweight or obese is a risk factor for several
negative health consequences. These include, but are not limited to, an
increased risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes,
liver disease, sleep apnea, colon cancer, breast cancer, infertility,
and arthritis. Given that it is estimated that in the United States
around one-third of the adult population is obese and that nearly
two-thirds of adults and one in six children qualify as overweight (CDC,
2012), there is substantial interest in trying to understand how to
combat this important public health concern.

What causes someone to be overweight or obese? You have already read
that both genes and environment are important factors for determining
body weight, and if more calories are consumed than expended, excess
energy is stored as fat. However, socioeconomic status and the physical
environment must also be considered as contributing factors (CDC, 2012).
For example, an individual who lives in an impoverished neighborhood
that is overrun with crime may never feel comfortable walking or biking
to work or to the local market. This might limit the amount of physical
activity in which he engages and result in an increased body weight.
Similarly, some people may not be able to afford healthy food options
from their market, or these options may be unavailable (especially in
urban areas or poorer neighborhoods); therefore, some people rely
primarily on available, inexpensive, high fat, and high calorie fast
food as their primary source of nutrition.

Generally, overweight and obese individuals are encouraged to try to
reduce their weights through a combination of both diet and exercise.
While some people are very successful with these approaches, many
struggle to lose excess weight. In cases in which a person has had no
success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death
because of obesity, bariatric surgery may be recommended. **Bariatric
surgery**\ {: data-type=“term”} is a type of surgery specifically aimed
at weight reduction, and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal
system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten and/or limiting
how much of the digested food can be absorbed
(`[link] <#Figure_10_02_Bariatric>`__) (Mayo Clinic, 2013). A recent
meta-analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than
non-surgical treatment for obesity in the two-years immediately
following the procedure, but to date, no long-term studies yet exist
(Gloy et al., 2013).

of a stomach. A bulging area directly above the gastric band is labeled
“Small stomach pouch.” The area directly below the stomach is labeled
“Duodenum.” Down-facing arrows indicate the direction in which digested
food travels from the esophagus at the top, down through the stomach,
and into the duodenum.|\ {: #Figure_10_02_Bariatric}

      Prader-Willi Syndrome

   **Prader-Willi Syndrome**\ {: data-type=“term” .no-emphasis} (PWS) is
   a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense
   hunger and reduced rates of metabolism. Typically, affected children
   have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not
   engage in excessive eating. Currently, PWS is the leading genetic
   cause of morbid obesity in children, and it is associated with a
   number of cognitive deficits and emotional problems
   (`[link] <#Figure_10_02_Obesity>`__).

   |A painting shows Eugenia Martínez Vallejo.|\ {:
   #Figure_10_02_Obesity}

   While genetic testing can be used to make a diagnosis, there are a
   number of behavioral diagnostic criteria associated with PWS. From
   birth to 2 years of age, lack of muscle tone and poor sucking
   behavior may serve as early signs of PWS. Developmental delays are
   seen between the ages of 6 and 12, and excessive eating and cognitive
   deficits associated with PWS usually onset a little later.

   While the exact mechanisms of PWS are not fully understood, there is
   evidence that affected individuals have hypothalamic abnormalities.
   This is not surprising, given the hypothalamus’s role in regulating
   hunger and eating. However, as you will learn in the next section of
   this chapter, the hypothalamus is also involved in the regulation of
   sexual behavior. Consequently, many individuals suffering from PWS
   fail to reach sexual maturity during adolescence.

   There is no current treatment or cure for PWS. However, if weight can
   be controlled in these individuals, then their life expectancies are
   significantly increased (historically, sufferers of PWS often died in
   adolescence or early adulthood). Advances in the use of various
   psychoactive medications and growth hormones continue to enhance the
   quality of life for individuals with PWS (Cassidy & Driscoll, 2009;
   Prader-Willi Syndrome Association, 2012).

EATING DISORDERS
================

While nearly two out of three US adults struggle with issues related to
being overweight, a smaller, but significant, portion of the population
has eating disorders that typically result in being normal weight or
underweight. Often, these individuals are fearful of gaining weight.
Individuals who suffer from bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa face
many adverse health consequences (Mayo Clinic, 2012a, 2012b).

People suffering from **bulimia nervosa**\ {: data-type=“term”} engage
in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to compensate
for the large amount of food consumed. Purging the food by inducing
vomiting or through the use of laxatives are two common compensatory
behaviors. Some affected individuals engage in excessive amounts of
exercise to compensate for their binges. Bulimia is associated with many
adverse health consequences that can include kidney failure, heart
failure, and tooth decay. In addition, these individuals often suffer
from anxiety and depression, and they are at an increased risk for
substance abuse (Mayo Clinic, 2012b). The lifetime prevalence rate for
bulimia nervosa is estimated at around 1% for women and less than 0.5%
for men (Smink, van Hoeken, & Hoek, 2012).

As of the 2013 release of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth
edition*, **Binge eating disorder**\ {: data-type=“term”} is a disorder
recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Unlike with
bulimia, eating binges are not followed by inappropriate behavior, such
as purging, but they are followed by distress, including feelings of
guilt and embarrassment. The resulting psychological distress
distinguishes binge eating disorder from overeating (American
Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).

**Anorexia nervosa**\ {: data-type=“term”} is an eating disorder
characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average
through starvation and/or excessive exercise. Individuals suffering from
anorexia nervosa often have a **distorted body image**\ {:
data-type=“term”}, referenced in literature as a type of body
dysmorphia, meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though
they are not. Like bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa is associated with
a number of significant negative health outcomes: bone loss, heart
failure, kidney failure, amenorrhea (cessation of the menstrual period),
reduced function of the gonads, and in extreme cases, death.
Furthermore, there is an increased risk for a number of psychological
problems, which include anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and substance
abuse (Mayo Clinic, 2012a). Estimates of the prevalence of anorexia
nervosa vary from study to study but generally range from just under one
percent to just over four percent in women. Generally, prevalence rates
are considerably lower for men (Smink et al., 2012).

   Watch this `news story <http://openstax.org/l/anorexic>`__ about an
   Italian advertising campaign to raise public awareness of anorexia
   nervosa.

While both anorexia and bulimia nervosa occur in men and women of many
different cultures, Caucasian females from Western societies tend to be
the most at-risk population. Recent research indicates that females
between the ages of 15 and 19 are most at risk, and it has long been
suspected that these eating disorders are culturally-bound phenomena
that are related to messages of a thin ideal often portrayed in popular
media and the fashion world (`[link] <#Figure_10_02_Model>`__) (Smink et
al., 2012). While social factors play an important role in the
development of eating disorders, there is also evidence that genetic
factors may predispose people to these disorders (Collier & Treasure,
2004).

Summary
=======

Hunger and satiety are highly regulated processes that result in a
person maintaining a fairly stable weight that is resistant to change.
When more calories are consumed than expended, a person will store
excess energy as fat. Being significantly overweight adds substantially
to a person’s health risks and problems, including cardiovascular
disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and other medical issues.
Sociocultural factors that emphasize thinness as a beauty ideal and a
genetic predisposition contribute to the development of eating disorders
in many young females, though eating disorders span ages and genders.

Critical Thinking Questions
===========================

.. container::

   .. container::

      The index that is often used to classify people as being
      underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese
      is called BMI. Given that BMI is calculated solely on weight and
      height, how could it be misleading?

   .. container::

      Using BMI as a sole metric can actually be misleading because
      people who have large amounts of lean muscle mass can actually be
      characterized as being overweight or obese based on their height
      and weight. Weight versus height is a somewhat crude measurement
      as it doesn’t distinguish the amount of body weight that comes
      from lean versus fatty tissue.

.. container::

   .. container::

      As indicated in this section, Caucasian women from industrialized,
      Western cultures tend to be at the highest risk for eating
      disorders like anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Why might this be?

   .. container::

      These disorders are closely associated with sociocultural emphasis
      on a thin-ideal that is often portrayed in media. Given that
      non-Caucasians are under-represented in popular media in the West
      and that the thin-ideal is more heavily emphasized for women, this
      particular group is most vulnerable.

Personal Application Question
=============================

.. container::

   .. container::

      Think about popular television programs on the air right now. What
      do the women in these programs look like? What do the men look
      like? What kinds of messages do you think the media is sending
      about men and women in our society?
