Every story has an ending. Death marks the end of your life story
(`[link] <#Figure_09_05_Cemetery>`__). Our culture and individual
backgrounds influence how we view death. In some cultures, death is
accepted as a natural part of life and is embraced. In contrast, until
about 50 years ago in the United States, a doctor might not inform
someone that they were dying, and the majority of deaths occurred in
hospitals. In 1967 that reality began to change with Cicely Saunders,
who created the first modern **hospice**\ {: data-type=“term”} in
England. The aim of hospice is to help provide a death with dignity and
pain management in a humane and comfortable environment, which is
usually outside of a hospital setting. In 1974, Florence Wald founded
the first hospice in the United States. Today, hospice provides care for
1.65 million Americans and their families. Because of hospice care, many
terminally ill people are able to spend their last days at home.

Research has indicated that hospice care is beneficial for the patient
(Brumley, Enquidanos, & Cherin, 2003; Brumley et al., 2007; Godkin,
Krant, & Doster, 1984) and for the patient’s family (Rhodes, Mitchell,
Miller, Connor, & Teno, 2008; Godkin et al., 1984). Hospice patients
report high levels of satisfaction with hospice care because they are
able to remain at home and are not completely dependent on strangers for
care (Brumley et al., 2007). In addition, hospice patients tend to live
longer than non-hospice patients (Connor, Pyenson, Fitch, Spence, &
Iwasaki, 2007; Temel et al., 2010). Family members receive emotional
support and are regularly informed of their loved one’s treatment and
condition. The family member’s burden of care is also reduced (McMillan
et al., 2006). Both the patient and the patient’s family members report
increased family support, increased social support, and improved coping
while receiving hospice services (Godkin et al., 1984).

How do you think you might react if you were diagnosed with a terminal
illness like cancer? Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (1969), who worked with the
founders of hospice care, described the process of an individual
accepting his own death. She proposed five stages of grief: denial,
anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Most individuals
experience these stages, but the stages may occur in different orders,
depending on the individual. In addition, not all people experience all
of the stages. It is also important to note that some psychologists
believe that the more a dying person fights death, the more likely he is
to remain stuck in the denial phase. This could make it difficult for
the dying person to face death with dignity. However, other
psychologists believe that not facing death until the very end is an
adaptive coping mechanism for some people.

Whether due to illness or old age, not everyone facing death or the loss
of a loved one experiences the negative emotions outlined in the
Kübler-Ross model (Nolen-Hoeksema & Larson, 1999). For example, research
suggests that people with religious or spiritual beliefs are better able
to cope with death because of their hope in an afterlife and because of
social support from religious or spiritual associations (Hood, Spilka,
Hunsberger, & Corsuch, 1996; McIntosh, Silver, & Wortman, 1993;
Paloutzian, 1996; Samarel, 1991; Wortman & Park, 2008).

A prominent example of a person creating meaning through death is Randy
Pausch, who was a well-loved and respected professor at Carnegie Mellon
University. Diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer in his mid-40s and
given only 3–6 months to live, Pausch focused on living in a fulfilling
way in the time he had left. Instead of becoming angry and depressed, he
presented his now famous last lecture called “Really Achieving Your
Childhood Dreams.” In his moving, yet humorous talk, he shares his
insights on seeing the good in others, overcoming obstacles, and
experiencing zero gravity, among many other things. Despite his terminal
diagnosis, Pausch lived the final year of his life with joy and hope,
showing us that our plans for the future still matter, even if we know
that we are dying.

Summary
=======

Death marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we
might react when facing death. Kübler-Ross developed a five-stage model
of grief as a way to explain this process. Many people facing death
choose hospice care, which allows their last days to be spent at home in
a comfortable, supportive environment.

Critical Thinking Questions
===========================

.. container::

   .. container::

      Describe the five stages of grief and provide examples of how a
      person might react in each stage.

   .. container::

      The first stage is denial. The person receives news that he is
      dying, and either does not take it seriously or tries to escape
      from the reality of the situation. He might say something like,
      “Cancer could never happen to me. I take good care of myself. This
      has to be a mistake.” The next stage is anger. He realizes time is
      short, and he may not have a chance to accomplish what he wanted
      in life. “It’s not fair. I promised my grandchildren that we would
      go to Disney World, and now I’ll never have the chance to take
      them.” The third stage is bargaining. In this stage, he tries to
      delay the inevitable by bargaining or pleading for extra time,
      usually with God, family members, or medical care providers. “God,
      just give me one more year so I can take that trip with my
      grandchildren. They’re too young to understand what’s happening
      and why I can’t take them.” The fourth stage is depression. He
      becomes sad about his impending death. “I can’t believe this is
      how I’m going to die. I’m in so much pain. What’s going to become
      of my family when I’m gone?” The final stage is acceptance. This
      stage is usually reached in the last few days or weeks before
      death. He recognizes that death is inevitable. “I need to get
      everything in order and say all of my good-byes to the people I
      love.”
